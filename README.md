# Morrog Speak
A runelite plugin which voiceovers all quests with random Dutch voices.  
The player is being voiced by a popular Dutch livestreamer called Morrog.  

All voiceover audio is pre-generated on a server, currently all quests are available!  

A random voice has been assigned to each character based on their gender from a pool of 150+ dutch voices, not all quests have been fully tested.  

Due to the voiceovers being pre-generated, some voicelines which include a specific amount of items or are specific to your game are either generalized or unable to be spoken out.  

If you come across non working voice lines, we can tweak the conversion on the server so do let us know!  

This project is a collaboration between:  
* Morrog - [twitch.tv/morrog](https://twitch.tv/morrog)  
* ProgrammeerMeneer -  [programmeermeneer.nl](https://programmeermeneer.nl)
