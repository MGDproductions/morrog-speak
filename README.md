# Morrog Speak
A runelite plugin which voiceovers all quests with random Dutch voices.  
The player is being voiced by a popular Dutch livestreamer called Morrog.  

All voiceover audio is pre-generated on a server, currently all quests are available!  
A random voice has been assigned to each character based on their gender from a pool of 150+ dutch voices, not all quests have been fully tested.

This project is a collaboration between:  
* Morrog - [twitch.tv/morrog](https://twitch.tv/morrog)  
* ProgrammeerMeneer -  [programmeermeneer.nl](https://programmeermeneer.nl)
